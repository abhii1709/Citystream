CityStream


CityStream is a cloud-native, real-time data pipeline project that streams, processes, stores, analyzes, and visualizes city traffic data â€” now enhanced with a Machine Learning model to simulate traffic signal timings based on congestion levels and vehicle counts.

Project Overview


CityStream demonstrates the end-to-end flow of real-time data through a modern, scalable, cloud-native architecture:

FastAPI provides an endpoint holding real-time traffic data.

Kafka Producer fetches data from FastAPI and publishes it to Kafka Topics.

Kafka Consumer reads data from topics and stores it into AWS S3 in Parquet format.

AWS Glue catalogs and transforms the raw data.

AWS Athena enables querying on S3 data.

Power BI connects to Athena for real-time visualization.

Machine Learning

Model predicts traffic light durations (green, yellow, red) for different city intersections based on traffic data.
